## Development & Innovation Roadmap
# Evolution of our roadmap →


### Previous development roadmap

```
Back in 2020, IBM released
an ambitious roadmap for maturing
and scaling quantum technology.
```
```
This roadmap set us on course
to deliver a 1,000+ qubit chip in
just three years while developing
software and services necessary
to run applications on
quantum systems.
```

### Previous development roadmap
```
By 2023, our research
and development work made
it possible to use quantum
computers as tools to run
circuits beyond the reach
of brute-force classical
computation. We could
also begin thinking about
implementing error correction.
We realized: it was time
for a bigger roadmap.
```

### Updated development

### roadmap

```
Our updated development
roadmap charts our course for
delivering client-facing systems
and services. It now focuses both
on qubit countand on the size of
the circuits that our systems can
run, tracked by the number of gates
in those circuits.
```
```
You can start exploring quantum
utility today, and this roadmap
shows how the quantum workload
size available for that exploration
will increase.
```
```
Our challenge is to develop the
tools that users need to explore
quantum utility and unlock the
full power of quantum-centric
supercomputing by 2033.
```
```
We will also incorporate advances
in machine learning and generative
AIto turbocharge our software's
performance.
```

### What we have accomplished:

### Hardware

```
From 2020 to 2023, we focused
on solving single-chip scaling
with the IBM Quantum Falcon,
Hummingbird, Eagle, Osprey,
and Condor chips.
```
```
In 2023, we debuted the IBM
Quantum Heron chip, which uses
tunable couplers to achieve our
lowest error rates yet. Heron will
serve as the basis for modular
scaling of quantum processors.
In 2024, Heron will be capable
of running 5,000 gates.
```

### Looking forward:

### Hardware

```
Now, we useerror mitigation and
interconnects to run larger circuits
so users can look for quantum
advantages in their domains.
Through classical and quantum
modularity, we plan to achieve an
IBM Quantum Flamingo system
capable of running 15,000 gates
with the help of error mitigation
by 2028.
```
```
We foresee advances in quantum
error correction allowing us to debut
IBM Quantum Starling, a system
capable of running circuits with 100
million gates on 200 logical qubits,
by 2029. In 2033, we will debut IBM
Quantum Blue Jay, a system capable
of running circuits with a billion gates
on 2,000 logical qubits.
```
```
As we roll out error correction,
developers need not change how
they write quantum programs. They
will simply notice that they can run
longer workloads.
```

### What we have accomplished:

### Execution and orchestration

```
Running quantum workloads
requires infrastructure that
coordinates quantum resources
with near-time and real-time
classical resources.
```
```
Since 2016, we have worked to
create Qiskit and a variety of
application libraries to show our
users what coding a quantum
computer looks like.
```
```
In 2021, we released Qiskit
Runtime, a service allowing users
to orchestrate their programs
across IBM Quantum processors
and the cloud.
```
```
In 2023, we introduced
middleware for quantum tools to
automate and optimize
heterogeneous compute tasks.
That included quantum serverless
to provision users the exact
quantum resources they need,
when they need them.
```

### Looking forward:

### Execution and orchestration

```
In 2024, our AI-powered transpiler
service will optimize circuits with
fewer gates.
```
```
In 2025, we will introduce resource
management tools to facilitate
system partitioning and enable
parallel execution.
```
```
2026 will bring us circuit
knitting across parallel quantum
processors—the ability to
decompose quantum circuits
into shorter circuits, run them
in parallel, and then stitch them
back together with classical
hardware. Circuit knitting will bring
performance gains and let you
run complex algorithms sooner.
```
```
From 2027 onward, we will focus
on intelligent orchestration:
optimizing workflows to combine
classical and quantum efficiently,
thus improving performance.
```

### What we have accomplished:

### Software

```
Useful quantum computing
requires performant software.
We’re committed to maturing
Qiskit into a software stack
capable of running utility-scale
circuits on cloud-based quantum
resources. As we say, Qiskit + IBM
Quantum systems = work.
```
```
In 2023, we aggregated Qiskit
documentation and learning
resources into the IBM Quantum
Platform to create a single Qiskit
source of truth.
```

### Looking forward:

### Software

```
In 2025, we will introduce
quantum functions so users can
create and share reusable blocks
of Qiskit code.
```
```
2026 will bring mapping collections
so users can start automating the
process of mapping their specific
use cases to quantum circuits.
```
```
From 2027 onward, we will work
alongside clients to build use-case-
specific libraries as quantum
advantages emerge for a variety
of use cases.
```
```
By 2033, we expect to see
general-purpose quantum
computing libraries that users
can incorporate into a wide variety
of quantum applications.
```

### Innovation roadmap

```
We remain committed to the
transparent development of IBM
quantum hardware and software.
This includes showing off scientific
discoveries required to clear
roadblocks in the field.
```
```
Therefore, in 2023, we also
announced our innovation
roadmap. This roadmap features
internal releases of hardware
and software to enable the
subsequent milestones on
our development roadmap.
```
```
Some technologies on our
innovation roadmap will beinternal
proofs-of-concept to inform
future development. Others will be
prototypes for eventual release.
```

### Innovation roadmap

```
Our hardware innovations
focus on building interconnects
that allow us to scale
processors and parallelize
quantum workloads while
laying a foundation for quantum
error correction.
```
```
In 2024, we will demonstrate
m-couplers to seam chips together
and l-couplers to connect chips
over longer distances with Crossbill
and Flamingo, respectively.
```
```
In 2025 and 2026, we will
develop c-couplers capable of
linking distant qubits on the same
chip as required by error correction
schemes for a concept
called Kookaburra.
```
```
2027 and 2028 further pave
a path to error correction. Cockatoo
will debut logical communication
and Starling will be able to run
logical gates on error-corrected
logical qubits.
```

### Innovation roadmap

```
Our software innovations will
support the execution of large
circuits on modular quantum
computers and build the tools
for a frictionless developer
experience, rising to the
Development Roadmap in
the following years.
```
```
In 2023, we showed our plan
to incorporate AI into quantum
computing workflows with
AI-assisted circuit transpilation.
```
```
In 2024 and 2025, we will
prototype new tools for resource
management and scalable circuit
knitting for parallel execution and
classical reconstruction of circuits
at the HPC scale.
```
```
In 2026, we will prototype
a real-time error correction
decoder for later error
corrected systems.
```
